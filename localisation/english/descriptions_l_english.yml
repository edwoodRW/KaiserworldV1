 leader_desc_JAP_hirohito:0 "Emperor Hirohito ascended to the Japanese imperial throne in 1926 upon the death of his father Yoshihito. Hirohito had held the highest office in Japanese society for a good while longer though, as Yoshihito had suffered from a prolonged mental illness and had been stripped of his political influence in late 1921.\n\nUnder Hirohito's oversight, Japan secured the overlordship over Manchuria and Formosa, both previously run by Chinese warlords. Japanese curricula under Hirohito's reign saw a sharp turn towards Japanese nationalism, whereas his grandfather Meiji had favored westernization and liberalization in schools and Yoshihito had held a hands-off approach, instead allowing the provinces to set their own policy goals. Hirohito instead lended an open ear to radical lawmakers like Hideki Tojo and allowed the 1928 Supremacy Decree and the 1929 Japanese Educational Supremacy Act to be passed through parliament, both of whom were described as "openly fascistic" by outside observers."
 leader_desc_USA_james_w_wadsworth:0 "James Wolcott Wadsworth junior is the 21st President of the United States since his election victory over incumbent Democrat Calvin Coolidge in the 1932 election.\n\nWadsworth's administration has seen steady recovery from Coolidge's disastrous economic policies, as the old President has favored libertarian government reduction at a time when a government-provided safety net was most needed by America's poor. However, Wadsworth was not able to fulfill several of his social liberalization promises that he made to northern liberals, and his own Republican Party is not entirely happy with his presidency."
